Welcome, fellow developers! This document outlines a set of features and enhancements for the Events Community Web App. Our goal is to transform this simple webpage into a powerful, interactive hub for connecting, learning, and networking.

We're open-sourcing this project to the community, offering you a unique opportunity to contribute to a live product and add significant projects to your resume. Each of the following sections represents a distinct feature that needs to be designed, developed, and integrated into the current application.

If your code is accepted then you will receive a certificate of participation as a token of appreciation, so you can add that to your extra-curicular activities column under your resume.
